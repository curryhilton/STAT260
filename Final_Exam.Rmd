**Instructions**:  Please select the correct answer from the choices given.  Enter the "Letter" (A, B, C, or D) for multiple choice type questions and for True or False type questions, enter the "Letter" either (A = TRUE or B = FALSE) depending on the correct answer.  This exam is due at 11:59 PM on August 5, 2016.  All questions must be answered and submitted within the Midterm Exam link found on BlackBoard.  No late submissions will be accepted regardless the circumstances.  You are to work *independently* on this exam.  You are allowed to use any resources available, notes from class, your book, the previous group assignments/problem set/labs, internet, etc.  Any questions regarding wording of questions or for further clarity must be directed through me (I promise to provide a response within 1 hour from the time of the email or text).  Just to reiterate, you are bound under the student conduct agreement for testing procedures and will be held accountable for any academic misconduct.  Do work!

### 3.
**True or False**: A statistical researcher would *fail to reject* the null hypothesis in a one-tailed hypothesis test with the calculated z-test statistic, $z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}=1.14$, and $\alpha = 0.10$.  Assume the population standard deviation is *known*.

B) False 

### 4.
A survey taken in 2014 showed that the average age men get married is 23.44.  A social scientist believes this value has increased in 2015 and decides to propose a study with the following hypothesis test.  Her sample results in a mean of 24.5.

The 95% confidence interval for the true population mean is: 

A) (4.43 - 5.57)
