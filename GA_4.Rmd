### Q4

According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Admistration (NOAA), the state of Alabama averages 25 tornadoes every April (30 days).

- What is the probability of less than 3 tornadoes per day?

### Q1

A sample of 20 observations have been collected on number of beers consumed by students on home Bama baseball games. The sample mean and sample standard deviation are, $\bar{x} = 5$ and $s = 2$, respectively. The population standard deviation is *unknown* in this case. What is the 95% conÔ¨Ådence interval for the true population mean?

### Q2

The overall population mean of the number of days students lift weights each week is 2.78 days with a *known* standard deviation of 2.56 days. Compute a 99% confidence interval for the true population mean when $n=30$?  

### Q3

The 'MLB' dataset in the openintro package refers to the salaries ("salary") of each major league baseball player in 2010 (assume population).  Follow the directions below:

a) Calculate the population parameters, $\mu$ and $\sigma$

b) Take a random sample of 100 players and assign it the name of "samp" using the following code:

```{r}
library(openintro)
set.seed(1986)
samp <- sample(MLB$salary, 100)
```

c) Calculate the sample statistics, $\bar{x}$ and $s$ from the sample taken

d) Contrust the 95% confidence interval assuming the population standard deviation is *known*; Use $\sigma$

e) Construct the 95% confidence interval assuming the population standard deviation is *unknown*; Use $s$ 

f) Compare the two confidence intervals in terms of range and the critical values, $z$ and $t$.  Do both intervals "capture" the true populatoin parameter, $\mu$?
