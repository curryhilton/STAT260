## Installing R and R Studio

- **R** - http://cran.r-project.org
- **RStudio** - http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

## RStudio Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

![](RStudio_IDE.png)

### Four Panes in RStudio

- Console: Where live R Code is "ran"
- Source: Where R scripts or R markdown files are produced (ability to save)
- Environment (Workspace): Where R objects live
- Utility: Where directories, plots, packages, and help live

### Customization

- Tools -> Global Options ...
- Description of all Global Options: http://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200549016-Customizing-RStudio
- Under General
    - Uncheck "Restore .RData into workspace at startup"
    - Save workspace to .RData on exit to **NEVER**

## R Project

- File -> New Project

![](New_Proj.PNG)

- Select "Existing Directory" and find the folder system we setup for class!

## Let's Play in the Console!!! Whoop Whoop!!!

### Execute the following matematical operations:

- 5 + 9
- 9 - 6
- 5 / 3
- 4 * 16
- 16 %% 3 (Modulo - Remainder)
- log(2)
- 10 ^ 2

### Object Assignments "<-"

- Assign *x* a value of 5: x <- 5
- Print *x* to the console: x or print(x)
- Assign *y* an expression of *x* + 7: y <- x + 7
- Print *y* to the console: y or print(y)
- Assign the character string, "I love statistics!" to object *z*: z <- "I love statistics!"
- Print *z* to the console: z or print(z)
- Assign *k* to the logical outcome 4 > 3: k <- 4 > 3
- Print *k* to the console: k or print(k)
- Assign *d* and *c* simultaneously to the value log(8): d <- c <- log(8)
- Print *d* and *c* to the console...are they identical in assignment value?
- Assign the following string of data, beers

```{r}
beers <- c(1, 3, 4, 8, 2, 3)
```

- Print the string, beers to the console
- Type the function "ls()" in the console...what do you observe?

## Indexing

- In order to index or subset a string/vector of data...
    - x[i]
    - x[i:j]
    
```{r}
beers[1]           # bring back first order placement in vector (1)
beers[4]           # bring back fourth order placement in vector (8)
beers[4:6]         # bring back fourth to sixth order placements in vector (8, 2, 3)

```



## R Package Installation

- Tools -> Install Packages ...
    - Or ... in the console: install.packages(pkgnames)
    - Note: You will only need to install R packages **one time**
- Load Packages to the workspace: library(pkgname)
- Update Packages (when necessary): Tools -> Check for Package Updates ...

### Required Package Installations

- openintro

## Importing Data

### Internal R Datasets and OpenIntro Datasets

- datasets

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(help = datasets)
```

- openintro

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(help = openintro)
```

### From the Web

- Visit: http://www.data.gov/
    - Find and select the Agriculture link under Browse Topics
    - Choose the "data" tab
    - Choose the "Farmers Marker Directory and Geographic Data" dataset
    - Copy the link address in the "Reference" box
- Tools -> Import Dataset -> From Web Url ...
    - Paste link address and press OK
- Examine dataset: Call View() function

### From Directory

- Determine working directory
    - Session -> Set Working Directory -> To Project Directory
- From BlackBoard -> Module 2 -> Resources -> "New-Data-1.T15.txt" (save link as and place it in your folder system for class)
- Tools -> Import Dataset -> From Text File -> Browse and find "New-Data-1.T15.txt" in your directory folder and press **open**

### Import from CSV
- Follow R script provided

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(readr)                      # load readr package
getwd()                             # determine working directory
beers <- read_csv("dir/beers.csv")  # read csv file and name it beers
View(beers)                         # view beers data structure
```

### Import from Excel
- Follow R script provided

```{r, eval = FALSE}
libray(readxl)                     # load readxl package
getwd()                            # determine working directory
sat <- read_excel("dir/sat.xlsx")  # read excel file and name it sat
View(sat)                          # view sat data structure
```

## Examining Data Structures - Data Frames

- View the dataset: View(x)  *Note that the "V" is uppercase
- Names of the variables in the dataset: names(x)
- Structure and variable assignments of a dataset: str(x)
- Dimesions of dataset: dim(x) -> output (row, column)
- View first few observations or last few observations: head(x) or tail(x)
- Column selection: x$y

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(openintro)                 # open library for openintro
View(MLB)                          # view the MLB dataset
```

- Determine the names of the variables, structure, and dimensions for the MLB dataset
- Select the 'player' column in the MLB dataset and assign it to the name 'player'

## Help!!!!

- help("x")
- ?x

```{r, eval=FALSE}
help("openintro")
```
